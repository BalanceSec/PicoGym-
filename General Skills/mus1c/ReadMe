Description
I wrote you a song. Put it in the picoCTF{} flag format.

The lyrics.txt file downloaded has a bunch of lyrics about a ctf song 
after some googling turns out to be a language called rockstar 
https://github.com/RockstarLang/rockstar

After some more googling I found
https://codewithrockstar.com/online?source=/rockstar/examples/99_beers.rock 

throw the lyrics.txt file in that and you get: 
114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114

Copy those numbers and decode. I used cyberchef.org (use the magic if you don't know what it is)
The output of that is what goes inside the picoCTF{}
