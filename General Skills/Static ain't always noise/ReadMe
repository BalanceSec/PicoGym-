Download the files, 

I ran strings on the static file and found the flag in there but the directions say to run the script with the static file. 
strings static | grep pico


download both files. 
chmod +x ltdis.sh
./ltdis.sh static

It generates two new files
cat newfile (static.ltdis.static.txt)
flag is on line starting with 1020
