Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag in the same directory too.

similar to the last challenge, you need to input a password when running the file. The password is also hardcoded in the script but this time it is encoded. 

if( user_pw == chr(0x64) + chr(0x65) + chr(0x37) + chr(0x36) ):

Decrypt this to get the password. 
0x64
0x65
0x37
0x36

de76

chmod +x level2.py
python3 level2.py
Please enter correct password for flag: de76
Welcome back... your flag, user:
