Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag in the same directory too.

chmod +x level1.py
python3 level1.py
        It prompts with a password.
        Ctrl C
cat level1.py
        The last function has the password hardcoded '8713'
        Rerun the previous command and input the password. (Make sure the encrypted file is in the same directory and has the default name)
python3 level1.py 
please enter correct password for flag: 8713
Welcome back... your flag, user:
