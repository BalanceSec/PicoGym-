Description
Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too.
There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.


If you view the python file it shows the 7 possible hashes, I wrote a for loop into the python script to check all 7 and it printed out the flag. The edited fucntion looks like:

def level_3_pw_check():
    #user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    for i in pos_pw_list:
        user_pw_hash = hash_pw(i)
   #user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)
        if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
            print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
            decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), i)
            print(decryption)
            return
        print("That password is incorrect")
        
        
        I uploaded this edited working script here as well.
