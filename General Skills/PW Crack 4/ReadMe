Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too.
There are 100 potential passwords with only 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

Very similar to the last challenge, I added a for loop to the existing code and then ran it. I uploaded all files here.
