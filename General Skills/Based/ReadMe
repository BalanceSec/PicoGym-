Description
To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 29956.

This challenge will give you some characters to decrypt into Ascii and type in the results. You only have a limited amount of time for each prompt so you have to be fast

hex
