Description
Sometimes you need to handle process data outside of a file. Can you find a way to keep the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 4427.

When typing in the connect command it outputs a whole lot of text data. (nc  jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 4427)

I sent this data to a text file called plumbing.txt then grepped the file for the pico flag.

nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 4427 >> plumbing.txt
cat plumbing.txt | grep picoCTF
This outputs the picoCTF{}
